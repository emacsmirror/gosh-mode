Install

Now the most convenient way to install is

git clone git@github.com:mhayashi1120/Emacs-gosh-mode.git /path/where/you/like

(setq load-path (cons "/path/where/you/like/emacs" load-path))

# make more sophisticated way in the future release. (ex: make install)

.emacs Sample
-------------

;; Generally only following line is required.
(require 'gosh-config)

;; if gosh command is not in PATH
(gosh-register-command "/path/to/gosh")

Note
----
gosh-mode is forked from scheme-complete.el
Many code have been duplicated but specialize to Gauche.
